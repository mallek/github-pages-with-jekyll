# Starting my blog on github pages

Today I got a link about a bot that would teach me how to use github.  
I thought I knew everything I needed about github so I was hesitant to start.  
When I was looking over the content I noticed that there was a way to enable a blog on github pages.

I am taking that tutorial now and learning how to use github with pull requests that get approved.

It's a great experiance!
